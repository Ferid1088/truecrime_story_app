# ROADMAP

State file for the rebuild described in `docs/changing.txt`. One row per part. Status: TODO / IN_PROGRESS / DONE / WAITING_OWNER / BLOCKED.
Inside each part: an inventory note, a requirement table (test + live evidence per requirement), the three review passes, and "not verified" items.

## Parts

| ID | Title | Status | Commit | Tests | Live proof | Not verified | Next owner action |
|----|-------|--------|--------|-------|------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 0 | Foundation | IN_PROGRESS | | | | | |
| 1 | Models: Haiku out, cheaper model in | TODO | | | | | |
| 2 | Extraction as fixed JSON, parallelism, fewer better evidence items | TODO | | | | | |
| 3 | Research: Persian-canonical, more languages, YouTube as a main source | TODO | | | | | |
| 4 | Media to show in our film | TODO | | | | | |
| 5 | Story plan first, stronger writer, Persian master, native rewrites | TODO | | | | | |
| 6 | Host editorial: what Fereidoun says, when, persona and memory | TODO | | | | | |
| 7 | Fereidoun's visual direction: studio, looks, wardrobe, light, performance | TODO | | | | | |
| 8 | Film integration and UI | TODO | | | | | |
| 9 | Final live run, audit and report | TODO | | | | | |

## Part 0 — Foundation

Status: IN_PROGRESS

### Inventory
- (a) CLAUDE.md had only the no-push rule; ROADMAP.md did not exist. Both being created now.
- (b) Cost ledger: not yet inventoried.
- (c) Cost-estimate gates: not yet inventoried.
- (d) SearXNG: `config/searxng/` exists on disk — needs inventory of whether code still references it.
- (e) /health: observed live on 2026-10-15 reporting commit_mismatch=false despite API commit 97a1466... and worker_commit 9d7b384...; not yet root-caused.

### Requirements

| Req | Test | Live evidence | Status |
|-----|------|----------------|--------|
| 0a CLAUDE.md + ROADMAP.md created | — | — | DONE |
| 0b Cost ledger prices by resolved model, books failed-call tokens, fails loudly on missing price | | | TODO |
| 0c No cost-estimate gates block a run; actual-spend cap only | | | TODO |
| 0d SearXNG/search fallback removed (Brave only) | | | TODO |
| 0e /health commit_mismatch correct | | | TODO |

### Review passes
Not yet run (part in progress).
